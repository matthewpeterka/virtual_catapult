# Virtual Catapult Simulation for Statistics Classes


## Overview
This Virtual Catapult Simulation is a Unity application created in C# to aid statistics classes in understanding and 
analyzing projectile motion. It allows students to interact with a virtual catapult and launch projectiles while collecting 
data for statistical analysis. This README file will provide an overview of the application and guide you on how to 
use it effectively for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before using the Virtual Catapult Simulation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Unity 3D (version X.X.X or higher)
A computer with a compatible operating system (Windows or macOS)

### Installation
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.

Open the project in Unity by launching Unity Hub and clicking "Add" to add the project folder.

Once the project is added, click on it to open it in Unity.

You can now build and run the application by selecting the target platform (Windows or macOS) and clicking the "Build and Run" button.

## Using the Application
### Launching Projectiles
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a 3D environment containing a virtual catapult.

To interact with the catapult, use your mouse or touch screen to adjust the catapult's angle and power.

Click on the "Launch" button to fire a projectile. You can adjust the angle and power settings to observe how they affect the trajectory of the projectile.

### Data Collection
As the projectiles are launched, the application will collect data on each launch, including launch angle, launch power, and projectile distance.
